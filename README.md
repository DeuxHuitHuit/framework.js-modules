##### Works with the latest version of [Deux Huit Huit's framework](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/framework.js).

Collections of files we frequently use with our framework.

Files are separated into groups:

### Modules

Modules are singletons across the framework

### Components

Components are modules that are created and reference by the page or other components.

### Pages

Pages represent a page model associated with one or more routes.

### Transitions

Transitions represent the way things are animated when changing from a page to another.

### Functions

Functions (fx) are globally accessible and throw an error when called but not registered.

### Utils

Utils are some jQuery plugins/facilitator that won't fit elsewhere.
